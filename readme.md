# Blog Web App with EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB

This project is an educational undertaking to develop a blog web application using HTML, CSS, EJS templates, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. The main focus of this project is to enhance skills in EJS templating, back-end development with Node.js, and the integration of MongoDB as a database.

## About the Project

The **Blog Web App** is designed to serve as a platform for practicing EJS templating and implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB. The project aims to showcase the integration of different technologies, including front-end development with HTML, CSS, and EJS, along with back-end functionality powered by Node.js and MongoDB.

## Features

- Utilizes EJS templates for dynamic content rendering.
- Integrates MongoDB for database storage and retrieval.
- Demonstrates practical usage of EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB together.
- Sets the foundation for implementing CRUD operations in later stages.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Configure MongoDB connection settings in the appropriate files.
4. Use `node app.js` to start the server and launch the blog web app.
5. Explore the app's functionality, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- EJS
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- MongoDB

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the project serves as a starting point, future updates will focus on enhancing the front-end design and expanding the functionality to cover more advanced features.

Feel free to explore the code and gain insights into how EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB can be seamlessly integrated to create a full-fledged web application.
